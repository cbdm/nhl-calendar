This app serves ics calendars with NHL team schedules.
You can choose to receive a calendar with all the games of a team or just the home or away games.
The original goal was to have a home-only calendar that can help fans know when there is a home game and plan ahead to attend.

The app is live at [puckdex.cbdm.app](https://puckdex.cbdm.app) and you can see its status at [status.cbdm.app](https://status.cbdm.app)  
You can find examples of how to use the calendars in our [about page](https://puckdex.cbdm.app/about).
